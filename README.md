# Welcome to My Raspberry Pi 5 Admin Dashboard

I use my Raspberry Pi 5 as a server at home and connect to it via this website.

This setup was inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.picourse.dev/) through this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp4glSVPT8o&t=298s) (very inspirational, highly recommended!).
